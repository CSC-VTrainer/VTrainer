# VTrainer

Hello everyone!

The essence of our project is to track the correctness of physical exercises 
and, according to various physical indicators (position of body parts, posture, pulse, etc.),
suggest the most suitable sets of exercises.
VTrainer will have a light version for individual use 
and a version for business (fitness clubs, yoga centers, sports organizations). 
We also plan to use it in professional sports.

List of project participants:
Alexander Karavaev,
